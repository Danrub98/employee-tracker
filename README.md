## Description
     This project was created to have a Database that is able to have all the information about the employees of an organization. The Code works with Javascript, Node and SQL to store the data. To run the application, the User needs to download the information with "npm i" With this, the node folder will be created and all the functionality will be optimal. To run the code, the User needs to open the integrated terminal and type "node index" and the questions about the database will be displayed. This first commit only gathers some information and adds the employees, but in future deploys, it could erase data and override aspects of the database.

## Contribution
     The project is open source, it can be forked and upgraded.

## Test
     To run the code, just download the package with "npm i" and run the code with "node index".
